Description of the dataset, its structure, and conditions of use.

Dataset description

The dataset includes demographic and clinical characteristics (such as age, body mass index, infertility duration, and infertility type), baseline ovarian reserve markers (including anti-Müllerian hormone levels and antral follicle count), and detailed characteristics of ovarian endometriomas (size, laterality, and number).

It also contains information on the pre-IVF management strategy applied (ethanol sclerotherapy, surgical cystectomy, or no intervention), controlled ovarian stimulation parameters, embryological outcomes (oocyte yield, maturity, fertilisation, and embryo development), and reproductive outcomes following IVF/ICSI, where applicable.

All data have been fully anonymised. No direct identifiers (such as names, national identification numbers, or exact dates) are included, in accordance with ethical and institutional requirements.

Data access and reuse

The dataset is publicly available for academic, non-commercial research use. Users are expected to comply with relevant data protection regulations and to appropriately cite the associated publication when reusing the data. Any interpretation or secondary analysis remains the responsibility of the data user.

Purpose of sharing

The dataset is shared to promote transparency, reproducibility, and secondary research in reproductive medicine and fertility outcomes research.
